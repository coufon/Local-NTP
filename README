Author: Zhou Fang (zhoufang@ucsd.edu)
Reference: 
1. NTPv4: https://www.eecis.udel.edu/~mills/database/reports/ntp4/ntp4.pdf
2. Use part of source code from: http://blog.csdn.net/rich_baba/article/details/6052863

RUN:

build by 'build.sh'
run 'client' / 'server'

SETUP:

1. IP address of NTP Server (Time Master): 
	set IP in 'ntpconfig.h': 
	#define  DEF_NTP_SERVER0  "IP"

2. The client send 'N_sample' requests continuously
	set up 'N_sample' in 'ntpconfig.h':
	#define  NTP_SAMPLE 'N_sample'

3. 'N_sample' responses will be provided by server, they are processed by NTP algorithm
	MIN_NTP_SAMPLE  in 'ntpconfig.h': minimal number of successfully received responses to start NTP alorithm at client
	N_MIN_SURVIVOR in 'ntpconfig.h': minimal number of 'survivor' in NTP algorithm to get a synchronization result

4. Parameters
	DEF_PSEC in 'ntpconfig.h': period of NTP synchronization in seconds at client
	DEF_TIMEOUT in 'ntpconfig.h': timeout of receiving NTP response at client
	PREC in 'ntpconfig.h': client local clock precision 2^PREC
	DRIFT in 'ntpconfig.h': client local clock drift

	DEBUG in 'ntpconfig.h': print algorithm running information
	RECORD in 'ntpconfig.h': write synchronization result into file
	
	CLOCK_REAL in 'ntpconfig.h': use REALTIME clock, otherwise MONOTONIC_RAW (unavailable for now)
